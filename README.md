# Random Bible Verse Generator
This is a program that generates random bible verses from the New Testament.
You can choose to clone the github repository to a continious integration platform (Jenkins, Travis etc..)
Or you can schedule a task that simply runs the script.sh file. (The SMS service only allows one SMS per day)

## Dependancies
1. Python:  You can download it from the Microsoft Store on WIndows or by typing python in a terminal on Linux/MAC

* Note: The free SMS service allows up to 78 caracters, that's why there is an e-mail option in case the verse exceeds that length
